    <p>These chicken wonton tacos are similar to those at Applebees. I loved the ones at Applebees and decided to attempt a home version. Light and tasty, they make a great appetizer or a quick and easy main dish. Kids love them! Finally, a dish that makes use of ground chicken but is not so far-fetched. I bake the wonton wrappers to save time and eliminate most of the fat. I am extremely pleased with this healthier version. Top tacos with cilantro, red onion, or sweet onion, if desired. Serve lime wedges on the side.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>⅓ head red cabbage, sliced and chopped</li>
            <li>4 small carrots, peeled and grated</li>
            <li>¼ cup coleslaw dressing</li>
            <li>¼ cup red wine vinegar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons teriyaki sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sesame oil</li>
            <li>1 pound ground chicken</li>
            <li>¼ cup stir-fry sauce</li>
            <li>14 wonton wrappers</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix together cabbage, carrots, coleslaw dressing, vinegar, soy sauce, and teriyaki in a large bowl until well combined. Place in the refrigerator until flavors blend, 1 hour to overnight.</li>
        <br>
       
        <li> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). </li>
        <br>
    
        <li>Heat sesame oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir ground chicken in hot oil until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Pour in stir-fry sauce. Cover the skillet, reduce heat to low, and simmer.</li>
        <br>
       
        <li>While chicken mixture simmers, form wonton wrappers into taco shapes and arrange between the cups of an inverted muffin tin.</li>
        <br>

        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until firm and lightly browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Spoon 2 to 3 tablespoons chicken mixture into each wonton taco shell and top with slaw.</li>
     </ol>
